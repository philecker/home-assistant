## 📘 What Are Blueprints?

[Blueprints](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/) in Home Assistant are shareable automation templates that make it easier to set up complex automations with minimal YAML knowledge.

They allow users to reuse logic by simply filling out fields in the UI — no coding required!

> 📌 Great for beginners and time-saving for experts.
